# Dmitry's README

## Motivations behind this document
* Writing and maintaining this document helps me refine my thoughts, expectations and self-awareness
* You should know as much as possible how interfacing with me looks like
* To share my expectations for what I believe is the most effective way for us to work
* For you to help me improve and holding me accountable
* Hopefully, this will help us work better together

## –ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç, I'm Dima
I was born in 1992 and spent most of my live in [Rostov-on-Don](https://goo.gl/maps/JKqQuB141982). I like traveling, sport activites (football and squash recently, judo and kettlebells in the past), watch movies & series, [enjoy listening to music](https://youtu.be/CrTMc2i6Lzc). I used to play a lot texas hold'em, CS1.6, Dota2, LoL and WoW. I enjoy pure art of engineering and science. Dogs > cats üê∂ Simple > complex üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### My job and how do I manage
* Our users at the forefront of everything that we do
* Focus on product delivery through strong engineering culture and best practices
* I believe in compounding of continually improving small things through sort and quick iterations
* I believe in agile, devops and continuous delivery core principles
* I have little patience for bikeshedding, corporate culture, ‚Äúbox tickers‚Äù and ‚Äútalk and no walk‚Äù
* I have little patience for apathy and indifference
* Advocate of freedom & responsibility
* Bias towards action. There‚Äôs value on having strategic discussions but most of the time is best to start with small and fast iterations so that we can prove (or not) our assumptions (fail-fast / learn-fast) and make visible progress
* Experimentation and reflection as a constant practice. Experiment with people, tools, processes and environment.
* My language skills degrade fast as I get tired

### Communication
* I'm bias toward transparency and radical candour. Ask anything, I'm committed to never lie to you
* Psychological safety is important
* Nothing to hide, all to share
* We may have disagreements and that‚Äôs OK, it‚Äôs not personal
* If there‚Äôs something wrong, I appreciate hearing it from you so we can fix it together

### Feedback
* Feedback is critical to our success
* Radical candour at its heart but don‚Äôt forget the below bullet point
* [Three dimensions are required for people to continue to give you feedback](https://medium.com/@royrapoport/why-wont-you-talk-to-me-f30a01a1994c):
  * Safety (unlikelihood of being punished for giving feedback; should be high)
  * Effort (The amount of work in order to give feedback, also known as "how much do you argue when people give you feedback?"; should be low)
  * Benefit (how likely is it that giving you feedback will materially impact your behaviour? should be high)
* I‚Äôm making mistakes, please let me know ASAP and hold me accountable!

### The team
Let me try to describe my ideal for our team:
* Take control of, and responsibility for, our own destiny
* Have each other‚Äôs back
* Hold each other accountable
* Expect excellence in ourselves and each other
* Assume positive intent
* Always question, always ask ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù
* Constantly learn
* Crack a joke
* Get stuff done!
