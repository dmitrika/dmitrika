Born in 1992 and spent most of my live in [Rostov-on-Don](https://goo.gl/maps/JKqQuB141982). I like traveling, sport activites. Nowdays mostly chess, fitness and hiking. Watching movies & series, [and listening to music of course](https://youtu.be/CrTMc2i6Lzc) 🎸. I used to play a lot texas hold'em, CS1.6, Dota2, LoL and WoW. I enjoy pure art of engineering and science. Dogs > cats 🐶 Simple > complex 💁‍♂️

### My job and how do I manage
* Our users at the forefront of everything that we do
* Focus on product delivery through strong engineering culture and best practices
* I believe in compounding of continually improving small things through sort and quick iterations
* I have little patience for bikeshedding, corporate culture, “box tickers” and “talk and no walk”
* I have little patience for apathy and indifference
* Advocate of freedom & responsibility
* Bias towards action. There’s value on having strategic discussions but most of the time is best to start with small and fast iterations so that we can prove (or not) our assumptions (fail-fast / learn-fast) and make visible progress
* Experimentation and reflection as a constant practice. Experiment with people, tools, processes and environment.

### Communication
* I'm bias toward transparency and radical candour. Ask anything, I'm committed to never lie to you ✋
* Psychological safety is important
* We may have disagreements and that’s OK :)
* If there’s something wrong, I appreciate hearing it from you so we can fix it together

### Feedback
* Feedback is critical to our progress and success
* Radical candour at its heart but don’t forget the below bullet point
* [Three dimensions are required for people to continue to give you feedback](https://medium.com/@royrapoport/why-wont-you-talk-to-me-f30a01a1994c):
  * Safety (unlikelihood of being punished for giving feedback; should be high)
  * Effort (The amount of work in order to give feedback, also known as "how much do you argue when people give you feedback?"; should be low)
  * Benefit (how likely is it that giving you feedback will materially impact your behaviour? should be high)
* I’m making mistakes, please let me know ASAP and hold me accountable!

### The team
Let me try to describe my ideal for our team:
* Take control of, and responsibility for, our own destiny
* Have each other’s back
* Expect excellence in ourselves and each other
* Assume positive intent
* Always question, always ask “why?”
* Constantly learn
* Crack a joke 😏
